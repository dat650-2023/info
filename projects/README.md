## Project topics

For each project you have to 
- read a research paper
- present what you are doing
- create a high-level model/simulation of the system/attack in your paper
- create a report including some simulations results from your model.
- You are free to use and extend the lecture notebooks. 

## Project topics
If you have ideas for a project, please talk to us.

## Groups

The project should be done in groups of 2.
By October 0th please tell Arian by email who is in your group and what project you plan to work on.
Note that each project can only be assigned to one group, so in case 2 groups requested for the same project, the project will be assigned to the group that emailed earlier. 

If you have good reasons to work alone, talk to us about that.

## Presentation
All groups are expected to present their project to the class on Thursday 2nd November.
By that time, you should have read the paper and be able to present some ideas on what/how to model.
The presenation should mostly be about the paper itself, and it should include some ideas about what you want to model, and how. You don't need to present any simulations results.

## Collaboration
Each group needs to write their own code and report. However, talking to each other is of cause encouraged.

## Report
You need to hand in a report for your project. 
Code should be published on github.
The report should explain some background and show and explain your results.
You can also explain what you may add to your project, if you had more time.
The report should not exceed 10 pages latex article.
Alternative you could also hand in a jupyther notebook.

## Grading
The project will be graded based on the report.
Grading criteria are:
* Show understanding in the report.
* Extend of modeling/simulation.

While no simulation leaves nothing to explain, it is more important that you show that you understand results and assumptions you achieve, than that you have extensive simulations.
